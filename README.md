# GESTURE-CONTROL-ROBOT
Gesture Controlled Robot — A tilt‑to‑drive rover that reads hand motion with an MPU6050 on an Arduino Nano transmitter and sends commands over an NRF24L01 link to an Arduino Uno receiver, which drives four DC motors via an L298N for smooth forward, reverse, and precise turns.
